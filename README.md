# Photoshop Rich presence
There's many photoshop rich presences out there, but this one's by far the best.

Currently supports: Windows  
\* More support can come, however since I don't have a machine to test them on I can't add them. It's really, really simple, so if someone can figure it out please make a PR!

## How to Setup
1. Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v10 or above)
2. Download this repoistory by hitting "Clone or download" and then "Download ZIP"
3. Extract the zip somewhere you want to keep this
4. Open a terminal or command line
5. (Windows Only) Type `npm i windows-build-tools --global` and wait for it to finish
6. Navigate to where you put the folder ([How To](https://www.digitalcitizen.life/command-prompt-how-use-basic-commands))
7. Run `npm install` and wait for it to finish
8. Type `cd src` and then `node rpc`
9. From now on, if you want to run it, you can just type `node rpc` in the src directory :)

## Planned
It'd be cool to release a compiled exe or whatever... so maybe that someday.
